            {"genreName": "techno", "description": "Evolving from Electro-Funk music in the mid 1980’s, Techno focused more on having a repetitive melodic line, generally used for long DJ sets.

            {"genreName": "electro-funk", "description": "Electro, or Electro-Funk, is a descendent of Funk that drew heavily influence from Boogie, utilizing drum machines and distortion like talkboxes and vocoding to create danceable, lively music similar to Disco.

            {"genreName": "funk", "description": "Funk originated in the 1960’s as a mixture of Soul, Jazz, and Rhythm and Blues. Funk focused on complex rhythms played by overlapping instruments, emphasizing the downbeat of a measure to create a notion of swing, enhancing dancibility."},

            {"genreName": "civil rights freedom songs", "description": "As the name suggests, these were songs created and performed during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950’s and 1960’s, used to express emotions that black people had during the movement, and also served as a way to unify and empower the movement, sparking African-Americans across the nation to fight for radical change."},
            {"genreName": "rock", "description": "Evolving from Rock and Roll, Rock music was characterized by the introduction of the electric guitar in the 1960’s, as well as the continued influence drawn from other genres such as Electric Blues and Folk music, quickly rising to popularity and immediately producing several sub-genre."}, 
            {"genreName": "soul", "description": "Originating in the 1950’s and 1960’s, Soul music is characterized by catchy rhythms and improvisational additions, drawing influence from Rock and Roll, as well as Rhythm and Blues music.

            {"genreName": "soul jazz", "description": "A development of Jazz in the 1960’s that is incredibly similar to Hard Bop, but with the addition of influence from Soul music. It is considered to be earthy and blues-based, but with overtones of spirit, due to the injection of Soul into the instrumentation."}, 
            {"genreName": "modern jazz trio", "description": "A style of Jazz that grew to popularity in the 1960’s as an offshoot of Bebop, focusing heavily on complex instrumentation and melodic structures, but specifically restricting the number of musicians performing to 3, creating a much more structured melodic arrangement."},
            {"genreName": "vintage gospel", "description": "This is a term for the evolution of Gospel music in the 1960’s and continuing through the 1980’s that began to draw inspirations from other genres, such as Disco, Funk, and Jazz. There was also a larger focus on solo artists and performances as opposed to performing in groups and in the traditional church settings."}, 
            {"genreName": "rock-and-roll", "description": "A genre that became solidified in the early 1950’s, Rock and Roll drew inspiration from many genres coming before it, namely Jump Blues, Rhythm and Blues, and Jazz. The result was a dance rhythm normally played by a piano or guitar, alongside a double-bass and a drum-kit."},
            {"genreName": "hard bop", "description": "An extension of Bebop music, this genre arose in the 1950’s and took influences from Rhythm and Blues and Gospel music, creating a more rhythmic form of Bebop music, quickly progressing into the formation of Soul Jazz."}, 
            {"genreName": "urban blues", "description": "Urban Blues is a term used for the type of blues that originated around the 1940’s, where the performers had to adapt to more urban environments to perform, leading to sub-genres such as “Jump Blues”, which was much more up-tempo and aggressive than prior blues music, paving the way for the emergence of new genres. This was also one of the first uses of drum-kits in the instrumentation, which quickly became a commonplace in later music across genres."},
            {"genreName": "rhythm and blues", "description": "A direct descendant of “Boogie-Woogie”, Rhythm and Blues took on a grittier jazz-based interpretation, sometimes called “Dirty Boogie”, and quickly rose to popularity in the 1940’s."}, 
            {"genreName": "bebop", "description": "Bebop arose in the 1940’s as a form of Jazz that focused more on the instrumentation as opposed to dancing, as was common in “Swing”, which Bebop drew inspiration from. This focus on music allowed for faster tempos and more complex chords and arrangements, while also having more structure than the improve-heavy “Swing”, creating a single melody to begin and end the arrangements with."},
            {"genreName": "traditional gospel", "description": "This is the term for gospel music that came about during the 1930’s, with Traditional Gospel evolving directly from Gospel hymns of the 1900’s. This was considered the most prosperous era for gospel music, largely due to the Civil Rights Movement being incorporated and supported by gospel at the time, leading to nationwide popularity and recognition of the genre."}, 
            {"genreName": "swing", "description": "A direct offshoot of Jazz, Swing music was developed in the 1930s, sharing many similarities to New Orleans Jazz, such as one instrument playing a standard melody while other instruments improvised, but Swing music put special emphasis on the weaker beat, giving the music a “swing” when played."},
            {"genreName": "gospel hymns", "description": "A precursor to traditional and modern gospel, gospel hymns are characterized by the mixture of religious gospel songs, and black folk spirituals, featuring simple rhythms with complex melodies and memorable lyrics."}, 
            {"genreName": "country", "description": "Originated in the Southern US during the 1920’s, Country quickly became one of the biggest genres in America. It is a melting pot of many different cultures and genres, with much of the rhythmic aspects tracing back to African-American influences, with the banjo itself being invented in Africa and heavily used in black culture during this time."}, 
            {"genreName": "boogie-woogie", "description": "Rising in popularity in the early 1900’s, the Boogie-Woogie was an offshoot and evolution of Traditional Blues that focused more on dancing, oftentimes containing high-tempo rhythms and simple melodies."},
            {"genreName": "new orleans jazz", "description": "Also known as “Traditional Jazz” or “Dixieland”, this genre emerged in New Orleans at the start of the 20th century and incorporated many Ragtime elements, with a Trumpet playing a known melody while other instruments would improvise around it. New Orleans Jazz laid the groundwork for Jazz to continue to mature and grow throughout the 1900’s, and also spawn several other genres taking influence from Dixieland."}, 
            {"genreName": "traditional blues", "description": "This genre came about around the 1880s as one of the earliest forms of blues music.
